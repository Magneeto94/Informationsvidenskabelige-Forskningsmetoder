  1. working folder with a notebook, that contains code we have used to perform a sentiment analysis of tweets from the 18th of August 2020 to 6th of november 2021 that contains the hashtag #covidVaccine.
  2. the seccond folder contains the same code and data, but made in a script format that easier to run for new users and more reproducible.
