This notebook/script uses different packages in order to execute the natural language processing (nlp).
<br>
First and foremost does the script use spacytextblob==0.1.7, and the script as it is now will not work with another version of spacytextblob than this exact one.
<br>
Furthermore does the scrip use Pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn, and these will also have to be installed in order for you to run the script.
